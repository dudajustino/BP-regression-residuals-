Description:

"Residual_H_Log_Like_BP"
This program contains the functions used to calculate the residuals, the hat matrix and the graphs used in the article.

"residuals simulation - correct specification" 
The program is used to perform simulations of the residues under correct specification of the BP model.

"fixed precision error"
The program is used to perform simulations of residuals under incorrect specification of the BP model - Fixed Precision Error

"error in the covariate of the mean submodel"
The program is used to perform simulations of residuals under incorrect specification of the BP model - Error in the covariate of the mean submodel
