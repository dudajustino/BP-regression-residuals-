# Description:
*scripts*
* "residuals simulation" - correct specification <br>
  The program is used to perform simulations of the residues under correct specification of the BP model.

* "fixed precision error" <br>
The program is used to perform simulations of residuals under incorrect specification of the BP model - Fixed Precision Error

* "error in the covariate of the mean submodel" <br>
The program is used to perform simulations of residuals under incorrect specification of the BP model - Error in the covariate of the mean submodel

*source codes*
* "Residual_H_Log_Like_BP" <br>
  This program contains the functions used to calculate the residuals, the hat matrix and the graphs used in the article.
